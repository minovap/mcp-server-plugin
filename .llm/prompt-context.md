# Instructions

When creating new files attempt to split them up in smaller files if possible

Try building with "./gradlew build" to check for build errors and fix them

If you want to check if your changes are working you need me to install the newly built plugin for you, ask me first and then wait

You dont need to write a summary at the end, if it builds and looks good you can just end the message.
